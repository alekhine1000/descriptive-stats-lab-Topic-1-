# descriptive-stats-lab-Topic-1-
An interactive, beginner-friendly online tool for learning basic  statistics and data visualisation.
Online Stats Solver — Topic 1: Descriptive Statistics
Overview

This tool is designed to help beginners learn descriptive statistics through direct interaction with data. It allows learners to upload a CSV file, select a numerical variable, and explore key summary measures and visualisations.

This topic focuses on describing data, not fixing or modelling it.

What This Tool Does

Using a selected numerical variable, the solver provides:

Measures of centre: mean, median, mode

Measures of spread: minimum, maximum, standard deviation, quartiles, IQR

Histogram to visualise the distribution

Box-and-whisker plot to identify potential outliers using the IQR method

Skewness to describe the shape of the distribution

All calculations are performed locally in the browser. Uploaded data are not stored or transmitted.

Learning Goals

After using this tool, learners should be able to:

Describe a dataset using appropriate numerical summaries

Interpret histograms and boxplots

Recognise skewness and potential outliers

Decide which summary measures are most appropriate for a given dataset

How to Use

Open the web page.

Upload a CSV file containing at least one numerical column.

Select the variable to analyse.

Examine the numerical summary and graphs.

Answer interpretation questions based on the output.

Scope and Limitations

This tool does not perform probability calculations.

It does not remove or modify outliers.

It is intended for exploration and interpretation, not inference.

Probability models and standardisation are introduced in later topics.
